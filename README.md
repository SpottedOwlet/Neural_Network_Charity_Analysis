# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

<h2> Overview </h2>

<h2> Results </h2>

 <h3> Data Preprocessing </h3>
 
 - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
 - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
 
 
 <h3> Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model</h3>
 
 - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
 - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
 - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


<h2> Summary </h2>
